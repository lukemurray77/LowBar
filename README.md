# Lowbar 

This project is my attempt at reimplementing some key methods of the underscore.js library. 

Underscore is a JavaScript library that provides a whole mess of useful functional programming helpers without extending any built-in objects. See the underscore docs <a href="http://underscorejs.org">here</a>.

I have hosted this project on github pages, check it out <a href="https://lukemurray77.github.io/LowBar/">here.</a>
